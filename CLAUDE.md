# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a Slack bot proof-of-concept project. The codebase is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Development Setup
Since this is a new project, typical Slack bot development will likely involve:
- Setting up a Node.js or Python environment
- Installing Slack SDK dependencies
- Configuring environment variables for Slack tokens
- Setting up webhook endpoints or socket mode connections

## Common Commands
Commands will be added here once the project structure is established and package.json/requirements.txt are created.

## Architecture Notes
Architecture documentation will be added as the project develops its structure and components.
